# üåûProject Motivation

In the face of escalating climatic challenges due to global climate change, regions including and surrounding Singapore are experiencing an intensifying array of climatic anomalies. The rising incidence of high-temperature weather, the increased frequency of extreme precipitation events, and the continuous rise in sea levels are stark realities that demand our attention. These phenomena are more than just statistical fluctuations; they have direct and profound impacts on the economy, ecosystems, and public life. Against this backdrop, the significance of developing tools that transform climate data into intuitive insights has become clear.

We aims to develop an R Shiny-based visualization platform that will enable citizens and policymakers to grasp the data and trends of climate change visually. With interactive charts and simulations, users will be able to explore historical weather patterns, current climatic conditions, and potential future environmental changes. Moreover, the platform will offer functionalities to forecast climatic conditions for the upcoming 50 years, allowing us to make informed decisions based on potential future scenarios.

This initiative will not only heighten public awareness about the urgency of climate change but will also enhance the adaptability and disaster preparedness of citizens in their daily lives. We believe that the power of data can inspire societal concern for environmental conservation, thereby driving climate action.

# ‚òÅÔ∏èProject Objectives

## **Data Integration and Management**

-   To integrate historical and current climate data from reliable sources into a comprehensive database for use in the visualization platform.

-   To ensure data is regularly updated to reflect the latest information and forecasts.

## **Visualization and User Interface**

-   To develop intuitive, interactive visualization tools that accurately present complex climate data, such as temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and sea-level changes.

-   To design a user-friendly interface that enables users of varying expertise to easily navigate and understand climate data.

## **Analysis and Forecasting**

-   To implement analytical models that use historical data to forecast future climate conditions up to 50 years ahead.

-   To provide scenario analysis features that help users understand the potential impacts of various climate change trajectories.

# üìöProposed Methodology

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by Data Visualization

To facilitate a deeper understanding of climate dynamics, our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will leverage the following visualization concepts:

**Visualization of Uncertainty in Temperature Changes:** Using different **visualization tool**, we'll explore the distribution and density of temperature variations over the years, highlighting the uncertainty and range of temperature fluctuations.

**Multivariate Analysis of Climate Factors:** We aim to dissect the relationships between different climate variables, such as temperature, wind direction, and precipitation, alongside carbon emissions and sea levels, to identify correlations and interactions.

## Predictive Analysis by Data Visualization

Leveraging the insights gained from EDA analysis, we will project the climate conditions for the next 50 years. This predictive analysis will focus on

**Future Temperature Changes:** Employing advanced statistical models and visualization techniques, we'll predict temperature changes, considering factors like carbon emissions and sea levels.

# üëì Shiny App storyboard

The envisioned Shiny app is intended to be an interactive platform that clearly presents the variability of Singapore's weather conditions as well as the global climate warming situation, with options for users to select and view. The preliminary concept consists of several tabs, which include:

1.  Long-term monthly averages for temperature, precipitation, and humidity, as well as forecasts for the coming decades.
